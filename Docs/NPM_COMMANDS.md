```

### During Development
```bash
# Terminal 1:
npm run dev                    # Starts dev mode with hot reload

# Terminal 2 (optional):
# Edit files and watch hot reload in Electron window
```

### Before Release

npm run build                  # Create production build
# Test the built application
npm run client                 # Verify it works
```

# If something breaks:
npm install                    # Reinstall clean dependencies
npm run client                 # Try again

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "npm: command not found"
**Solution**: Install Node.js from nodejs.org

### "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
npm install                    # Reinstall packages
npm run client                 # Try again
```

### Port 3000 already in use
**Solution**: 
```bash
npm run client                 # Use Electron instead
# Or kill process on port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000   # Find process ID
taskkill /PID <id> /F         # Kill it
```

### Build fails with signing errors
**Solution**: This is normal on first build
```bash
# Just use npm run client or npm run dev
# Signing is only needed for actual distribution
```

### App won't launch
**Solution**:
```bash
npm install                    # Clean install
npm run client                 # Launch again
# Or run as administrator if admin required
