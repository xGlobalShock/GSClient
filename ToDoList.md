- Add a new tab on the nav bar and name it ( OBS Presets )
- Add ' Set services to manual ' to the system tweaks ( using the old project path )


Bug Fixes:

- System Tweaks tool is not scanning regedits properly.
( Users have reported that some tweaks were already showing " Reset to Default " even tho the tweaks were not done)
Note: Look into it and resolve the issue.
